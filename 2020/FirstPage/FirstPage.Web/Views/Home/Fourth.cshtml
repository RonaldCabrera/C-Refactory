            One of the most interesting and ethical uses of programming in cybersecurity is the ability to find errors and vulnerabilities in a security system. This, logically, allows these issues to be corrected, making the system increasingly impenetrable. In summary, programming can be used to find defects in code and help correct them.

            However, it can also be used for more nefarious purposes, such as breaching the security of a system.
